The information system checks the validity of `Assignment: organization-defined information inputs.`

**SI-10 Parameter Requirement:** Inputs shall be validated for correct syntax and semantics (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) to ensure they match specified definitions for format and content. Input validation protections will be tested through monthly operating system and web application vulnerability scanning as defined in control RA-5.

```
AWS Customer Responsibility Requirement:
Customers using the AWS virtual machine (EBS) offering should develop a policy identifying acceptable data types to be stored. The customer is also responsible for defining field types, creating input validation rules for specific objects, as well as configuring any input restrictions and conducting any validity checks required on the information they place into the storage environment. In addition, the customer is responsible for ensuring only authorized individuals are designated as administrators within the management portal.
