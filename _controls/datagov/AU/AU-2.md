## The organization
* Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following events:

`Assignment: organization-defined auditable events`

**AU-2a Parameter Requirement**: Successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management events, object access, policy change, privilege functions, process tracking, and system events.  For Web applications: all administrator activity, authentication checks, authorization checks, data deletions, data access, data changes, and permission changes.

* Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;
* Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and
* Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system:

`Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event`

**AU-2d Parameter Requirement**: Successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management events, object access, policy change, privilege functions, process tracking, and system events.  For Web applications: all administrator activity, authentication checks, authorization checks, data deletions, data access, data changes, and permission changes.  Settings to be audited continually for each identified event.

```
