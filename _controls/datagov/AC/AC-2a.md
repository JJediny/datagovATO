## Applications and Websites
`18F identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: individual, group, system, application.`

```
The Application system owner (SO) should ensure its applications provide a way to manage userâ€™s access using identifiers (i.e. individual, group, system, application, guest/anonymous, and temporary) if required and not handled by the 18F DevOps team.
