`Assignment: organization-defined frequency`

`18F reviews user and system accounts for compliance with account management requirements at least on an annual basis.  Currently, system and user accounts are being monitored manually on a monthly basis and programmatically on a continuous basis.`

```
Applications and Websites:
* All applications and websites residing in the Cloud Foundry platform as a services and 18Fâ€™s virtual private network will be monitored by the 18F DevOps staff.
* Any applications that are not hosted within the 18F environment or not managed by the 18F DevOps group will be the sole responsibility of the application system owner.
