Notes from AWS Public Summit


# Cloud Compliance: A New Generation of True Automation

## Data Flows

## Roles and Responsibilities

## Overlays
- How can you segment roles/levels/components
- Hybrid (how/who to implement)/Inhereted/All (policy and implementation)

## Auditabity
- Requires evidence/artifacts *ping various roles for ansewers (Survey)
- Risk review needed post audit failure (POAM&M report)

# Secuirty Talks
- Zone based architecture
- Nutonian (Product)

AI
- Making sense of logs - signal in the noise
- "Detected Invariance"
- 20% of patterns are NOT in the Data.

Steps to AI
1. Connect
2. Model
3. Explain
4. Unleash

Requires "Massive Parallel Analysis" massive CPU intensive processes
- These patterns exist in the data you have
-


# Data Processing withut Servers
-
* need to check if connection error is caused by a connection thred of 0 or 1 (1 == open/ongooing)


# Modern Security and Compliance Through Automation
